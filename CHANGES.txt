0.6.0 (2014-07-09)
==================

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

* Go 1.3 now required for building.

* Changed handling of message stream framing. Before stream framing was
  presumed to always be required when encoding with protocol buffers, and not
  required when using other encodings. Now all outputs support an optional
  `use_framing` setting that will determine whether or not framing will be
  applied when using the OutputRunner's Encode method (issue #922).

* All files in a config directory that do not end in ".toml" will now be
  ignored and not loaded as a part of the Heka configuration (issue #750).

* Removed the PayloadJsonDecoder which is replaced by the Lua sandbox cjson
  module (issue 826).

* Removed LogfileInput and LogfileDirectoryManagerInput which were replaced
  by LogstreamerInput in 0.5.0 (issue 914).

* MultiDecoder no longer sets prepends name of the decoder instance to the
  message type value for every message. This was impacting performance, is
  almost never what is needed, and is almost always overwritten by the nested
  subdecoders anyway.

* MultiDecoder now has a `subs` option that refers to other top level decoder
  config definitions, instead of nested sub-configs and a separate `order`
  option specifying the order. This makes for less typing and the ability to
  reuse decoder definitions as both standalone decoders and across multiple
  MultiDecoders (issue #485).

* ElasticSearchOutput now uses an Encoder plugin instead of MessageFormatters.
  Created ESJsonEncoder, ESLogstashV0Encoder, and ESPayloadEncoder
  (implemented as a SandboxEncoder in es_payload.lua) to replicate prior
  formatter behavior.

* Changed the Lua sandbox API.  inject_message is no longer overloaded, output
  has been renamed to add_to_payload, and inject_payload has been introduced.

* Changed TcpOutput, FileOutput, and LogOutput to use Encoder plugins for
  output formatting instead of bespoke formatting implementations.

* The rsyslog decoder now further parses the %SYSLOGTAG% variable. The
  fields.syslogtag no longer exists and is replaced by fields.programname and
  message.Pid (issue #677).

* Removed no-longer-used 'decoder_poolsize' global config setting.

Bug Handling
------------

* Fixed the ElasticSearchOutput to always use UTC times in the bulk API header
  (issue #504).

* Fixed the SandboxDecoder panic when failing the Decode() after successfully
  injecting a message (issue #910).

* StatsdInput no longer spins up a new goroutine for each stat (issue #359).

* MultiDecoder no longer prevents shutdown if a nested SandboxDecoder crashes
  during startup (issue #896).

* MultiDecoder using `cascade_strategy = "all"` now passes all generated packs
  to all nested decoders instead of skipping the remainder if an earlier pack
  in the sequence fails to decode (issue #896).

* MultiDecoder no longer tries to recycle the original pack, leaving that job
  to the DecoderRunner as intended (issue #896).

* Updated SmtpOutput to use a slice instead of a map to generate SMTP headers
  so the order will remain consistent when using Go 1.3 or later.

* Use FindProcess instead of syscall.Kill to make the 'pid_file' configuration
  setting work on Windows (issue #807)

* Fix the SandboxFilter ReportMsg panic on termination/shutdown (issue #816)

* MultiDecoder with no 'order' set now fails on init instead of panicking on
  first message.

* Fix panic on SIGUSR1 caused by no reports in a given plugin category (issue
  #832).

* Fix file_match config of plugin logstreamer_input (issue #893).

Features
--------

* Added general purpose HttpOutput (issue #820).

* Added message processing stat reporting to the MultiDecoder for each
  subdecoder and in aggregate (issue #719).

* Added memory statistics to the Heka report output, for self monitoring.

* Added a message type configuration option to the rsyslog decoder (issue #907).

* Added `elasticsearch` Lua module to generate BulkAPI index JSON (issue #875).

* Added support for Lua sandbox preservation versioning (issue #701).

* Added support for unix datagram sockets to the UdpInput using net "unixgram"
  (issue #790).

* Add LogstreamInput seekjournal reporting to dashboard output (issue #445).

* Added a HyperLogLog library to the Lua sandbox using the Redis
  implementation http://antirez.com/news/75.

* Added an alert encoder to make the alert messages easier to read.

* Introduced Encoder plugin type (issue #417).

* Added a bloom filter to the Lua sandbox and created a unique items filter.

* Turned the MySQL slow query log examples into a deployed decoder and filter.

* Added an Nginx error log decoder (issue #785)

* Added the ability to preserve the webserver log line in message payload
  (issue #784)

* Added the optional 'pid_file' configuration setting (issue #777).

* Add anomaly, alert, annotation modules (issue #677)

* Added 'sample_denominator' global config setting to allow tweaking the
  sample interval when computing timing of certain operations, replacing prior
  hard-coded DURATION_SAMPLE_DENOMINATOR constant (issue #625).

* Added an Apache access log decoder based on the Apache 'LogFormat'
  configuration directive.

* Added BufferedOutput. Extracts the queuing functionality out of TcpOutput.go
  into a general purpose lib for use in any output module. Callers get
  messages buffered to disk while another goroutine consumes and forwards
  data. Any errors encountered can cause the sending goroutine to backoff and
  resend data.

* Added http_timeout to elasticsearch output to prevent slow or stale
  connections from holding up the flow. (issue #769)

* Add query parameters to the Message as Fields in the HttpListenInput

* Add QueueTTL option to AMQPInput to allow specifying message expiration.

* Added optional tls sub-section to AMQPInput and AMQPOutput for configuring
  AMQPS TLS settings.

* Add detection and handling of gzipped files to LogstreamerInput (issue #648).

* Added optional TCP Keep-Alive parameters to TcpInput/TcpOutput plugins.

0.5.3 (2014-MM-DD)
==================

Bug Handling
------------

* StatFilter now correctly handles values from integer or float fields (issue
  #612).

0.5.2 (2014-05-16)
==================

Bug Handling
------------

* FileOutput no longer panics when using `format = "text"` and payload is nil
  (issue #843).

* Fix SandboxDecoder pass-through case so decoders that only use write_message
  and not inject_message will emit messages correctly (issue #844).

* Fixed TcpInput so it will only override the default delimiter for a
  RegexpParser if a delimiter is specified in the config.

* Fix the FileOutput panic when HUP'ed.  Modified the CheckWritePermission
  utility function to use a unique filename for each check. (issue #808)

* Terminated plugins are now removed from the SandboxManager quota (issue
  #774).

* Fixed SIGUSR1 triggered text report to stdout to work with updated
  heka.all-report JSON data structure (issue #762).

* MultiDecoder now uses message.GetType() instead of Message.Type so
  emitted message type will be generated correctly (issue #761).

* LogstreamerInput no longer causes Heka to fail to start on empty or
  whitespace-only journal files (issue #755).

* The cbufd_host_aggregator filter now properly reclaims expired hosts.

* Pull in a new lua_sandbox to fix JSON encoding of empty strings in the
  sandbox plugin output() call.

* Escape regexp meta characters (notably '\') to prevent a panic in the LogstreamerInput on Windows

0.5.1 (2014-03-18)
==================

Bug Handling
------------

* Skip *.bak, *.tmp, *~, and .files in a config dir as a non-breaking band-aid
  until we require an explicit naming convention in 0.6 (see issue #750).

* heka-logstreamer command now supports config directories in addition to
  single config files, just like hekad itself (issue #742).

* Logstreamer package's NewLogstreamSet function no longer lowercases the
  match part names when constructing match translation maps since the
  PopulateMatchParts method doesn't actually expect the names to be
  lowercased.

* Added support for use of "missing" value in Logstreamer translation maps to
  allow users to place missing values at the end of the list instead of the
  beginning (issue #735).

0.5.0 (2014-03-06)
==================

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

* ProcessInput no longer supports a separate'name' config setting, it uses the
  specified plugin name from the TOML section header like all of the other
  plugins.

* Removed Stdout_chan and Stderr_chan from ManagedCmd and CommandChain, client
  code now has direct access to Stdout_r and Stderr_r io.Reader providers.

* The PluginHelper interface DecoderRunner prototype has changed (issue #717) 
  to allow for the base name e.g. "ProtobufDecoder" and a full instance name
  e.g. "MyInput-ProtobufDecoder" of the decoder to be specified.  This allows
  multiple decoders of the same type to show up on the DashboardOutput and 
  sandbox decoder state preservation to work properly. Also the DecoderRunner
  UUID interface method was removed.

* FileOutput `flushinterval` config setting changed to `flush_interval` to
  match config naming conventions.

* SandboxDecoder, SandboxFilter, and SandboxManagerFilter now all use
  `${SHARE_DIR}/lua_modules` as the default `module_directory` setting.
  SandboxDecoder and SandboxFilter both now interpret relative paths to lua
  source code to be relative to ${SHARE_DIR} instead of ${BASE_DIR}.

* DashboardOutput `static_directory` setting now defaults to
  `${SHARE_DIR}/dasher` instead of `${BASE_DIR}/dashboard_static`.

* The sandbox preservation data is now stored in the
  {base_dir}/sandbox_preservation directory instead of with the plugin source.
  On the initial restart no preserved data will be restored unless it is
  manually moved to this directory first. (issue #626)

* The Heka utilities (flood, sbmgr, sbmgrload, inject) have been namespaced
  with a `heka-` prefix for their respective binaries. I.e. Flood has been
  renamed heka-flood., etc.

* MultiDecoder now gets its name from the TOML section name like the rest of
  the plugins, instead of a separate 'name' config option.

* Major reorganization of the `pipeline` package, moving the implementation of
  most plugins to sub-packages of a separate `plugins` package.

* Removed the wrapper 'table' element from the JSON serialization (issue #525)
  i.e., {"table":{"value":1}} is now simply {"value":1}.  The change also
  removes the special '_name' metadata arribute; the top level _name element
  should be created in the Lua structure if it is required.

* In the process of removing the core sandbox code from Heka (issue #464), the
  sandbox was streamlined to only load the base library by default. All sandbox
  plugins must now explictly load additional libraries with the require
  function.

* Removed DecoderSet method from PluginHelper interface (and DecoderSet
  abstraction entirely) and replaced it with Decoder and DecoderRunner methods
  that return a Decoder or a DecoderRunner by name.

* Changed Decoder interface to support one input pack generating multiple
  output packs.

Bug Handling
------------

* Network parsers now return all records available in the parse buffer
  (issue #732).

* TcpInput now stops a given connection's decoder when the connection is
  closed, preventing memory pooling (issue #713).

* StatsdInput now doesn't fail with multiple stats in a single UDP packet.

* Set default StatAccumInput stat namespace prefix values even when
  `legacy_namespaces` is set to false (issue #630).

* Fixed cpuprof file from being closed right after opening so no data was
  being logged.

* Fixed LogfileInput so it will only override the default delimiter for a
  RegexpParser if a delimiter is specified in the config.

* PluginWrapper will now check for the WantsName interface when creating a
  plugin, and will set the plugin's name if appropriate.

* SandboxDecoder now explicitly logs a fatal error before triggering shutdown
  to ensure error message is actually emitted.

* Message severity now defaults to the highest RFC 5424 value (i.e. 7) implies
  low severity, rather than zero, which implies `emergency`, (issue #518).

* 'flood' command now outputs every send error (even 'connection refused'), and
  always increments 'messages sent' count even when there is a sending error
  (so setting 'num_messages' still works even if hekad stops responding,
  etc.).

* stat_accum_input will not fail when flushing a timer where the percentile
  is equal to the min value.

Features
--------

* Added ProcessDirectoryInput.

* InputRunners now support being specified as 'transient', meaning their
  lifespan should be managed by the code that creates the InputRunner and not
  Heka's pipeline code.

* HttpInput: now supports configuring the HTTP method, HTTP headers and HTTP
  Basic Authentication

* TLS Listeners can specify a 'client_cafile' which limits the CAs that a
  client cert can be chained to. This provides a mechanism for TLS Client AUTH.

* TLS Senders can specify a 'root_cafile' which limits the CAs that a
  server cert can be chained to. This provides a mechanims for TLS Server AUTH.

* Added StopDecoderRunner function to PluginHelper API so inputs can manually
  decommission decoders when they're no longer being used.

* The SandboxManagerFilter can now control the sandbox usage limits (issue #95)

* Added support for send_nsca to NagiosOutput as an alternative to direct http
  submission; also a way to explicitely specify service_description and host
  to match Nagios config

* Added configurable network types to TcpInput "tcp", "tcp4", "tcp6", "unix" and
 "unixpacket" (issue #539)

* Added configurable network types to UdpInput "udp", "udp4", "udp6"
  (issue #539)

* Added flush_count config setting to FileOutput to complement existing
  flush_interval. Also added flush_operator setting which can be "AND" or "OR"
  to specify how flush_count and flush_interval should be combined.

* Introduced `share_dir` global config setting, which specifies where Heka's
  read only resources should live. Defaults to `/usr/share/heka`. Also added
  `pipeline.PrependShareDir()` function for use within plugin initialization
  code.

* Added an rsyslog decoder based on the rsyslog string configuration template
  (issue #432).

* Added an Nginx access log decoder based on the Nginx 'log_format'
  configuration directive.

* heka-cat: A command-line utility for counting, viewing, filtering, and
  extracting Heka protobuf logs.

* TcpOutput has been redesigned to handle unavailable endpoints and dropped
  connections without data loss (issue #355).

* CarbonOutput now supports submitting messages via UDP, persistent TCP
  connection.

* Added Logstreamer Input [LogstreamerInput]: An input that replaces the
  Logfile and Logfile Directory Inputs and supports sequential reading of
  logstreams that span sets of ordered logfiles (issue #372).

* TcpInput, TcpOutput, and flood client now all support TLS encrypted TCP
  connections using Go's crypto/tls package.

* Added Http Listen Input [HttpListenInput]: An input that listens for
  HTTP requests on the specified address. If a decoder is not specified the
  input generates a message with the HTML request body as the payload.
  This input is especially useful for consuming and processing webhooks.
  (Issue #431)

* Added support for local external packages (issue #393)

* Inject: A command-line utility for injecting arbitrary messages into
  a Heka pipeline.

* Added Go ScribbleDecoder for efficient setting of purely static message
  field values.

* Exposed `write_message` API function to Lua decoders to allow mutation of
  existing decoded message (issue #577).

* HttpInput: Added urls (array) option.

* HttpInput: Failed and successful HTTP GET actions produce messages of Type
  "heka.httpinput.data", Logger = Request URL, and severity appropriate to
  HTTP status 200 or not. I.e. Connections responding with a status of 200
  produce a message with Severity 6, non-200 statuses Severity 1. Failure to
  connect produces a message with Severity 1 and Type "heka.httpinput.error".

* HttpInput: Fields[ResponseTime] populates with time duration in seconds for
  HTTP GET of URL, Fields[Status] with HTTP Status, Fields[Protocol] with HTTP
  protocol and version, Fields[StatusCode] with HTTP Response Status Code for
  successful HTTP GETs. The Circular Buffer Graph Annotation (Alerts)
  (http://hekad.readthedocs.org/en/latest/sandbox/graph_annotation.html) plugin
  is compatible with the HttpInput plugin.

* HttpInput: Added success_severity and error_severity options for GET actions.

* HttpInput: Messages now set Logger, UUID, and Timestamp.

* Added log_errors option to PayloadregexDecoder to allow skipping invalid
  payloads.

* Added "id" flag to elasticsearch output (issue #386).

* Added SmtpOutput (issue #472)

* Added preserve_data option to SandboxDecoder (issue #668).

* Added delete_idle_stats to StatAccumInput.

* Added sum and count_ps metrics to timers in stat_accum_input.

0.4.2 (2013-12-02)
==================

Bug Handling
------------

* Changed CPack configuration such that the 'make package' target no longer
  creates deb packages, and added a new 'make deb' target that creates debs
  with the filename expected by the deb package naming conventions (see
  https://github.com/mozilla-services/heka/issues/545).

* Doc clarifications re: required use of ProtobufDecoder (see
  https://github.com/mozilla-services/heka/issues/550).

* Explicitly exclude system level folders from those that CPack will include
  as part of the Heka RPM (requires CMake >= 2.8.12) (see
  https://github.com/mozilla-services/heka/issues/548).

0.4.1 (2013-11-05)
==================

Bug Handling
------------

* Updated Mozilla Sphinx theme submodule reference and configuration paths to
  work around bug in ReadTheDocs rendering (see
  https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues/529).

* Changed default DashboardOutput.StaticDirectory value to
  `/usr/share/heka/dasher`, to match where the packages put the files.

Features
--------

* add require_all_fields flag to PayloadJsonDecoder
  (issue #528)

0.4.0 (2013-10-30)
==================

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

* DashboardOutput now requires a `static_directory` setting to specify where
  the Heka dashboard source code can be found.

* AMQPInput now only supports a single decoder to be specified (issue #414).

* UdpInput configuration now requires a parser_type and decoder to be specified
  (issue #411).

* TcpInput configuration now requires a parser_type and decoder to be specified
  (issue #165).

* Removed the LogfileInput decoders array configuration in favor of a single
  decoder (issue #308).

* SandboxManagerFilter now auto-generates a default working directory based on
  the plugin name, in the ${BASE_DIR}/sbxmgrs folder.

* LogfileInput seek journals now support a boolean `use_seek_journal` config
  flag, and only the name of the journal file is now settable via
  `seek_journal_name`, replacing the `seekjournal` option which specified the
  full path.

* Build is now entirely cmake based and lives directly in the heka repository,
  replacing the separate primarily gnu make driven separate heka-build repo.

* Core Heka plugins now default to writing data to /var/cache instead of
  /var/run since /var/run is usually deleted on server restart.

* StatAccumInput now defaults to emitting stats data in the payload instead of
  in the message fields.

* Renamed LoglineDecoder to PayloadRegexDecoder.

Bug Handling
------------

* Added check for nil RemoteAddr value since UDP connections won't have one
  (issue #462).

* Statsd messages are now parsed manually (issue #44).

* Added mDRunner so MultiDecoder will work with sub-decoders that implement
  the WantsDecoderRunner interface.

* Removed all code that attempted to catch and recover from panics in called
  plugin code, since a) the recovery often left Heka in an undefined, broken
  state b) the safety was a lie, any panic in a separate goroutine would not
  be caught and c) panic traceback actually makes it easier to debug.

* WhisperOutput and CarbonOutput no longer require stats to use the `stats`
  namespace prefix.

* LogfileInput now truncates and overwrites the seek journals instead of
  appending.

* `protoc` now an optional dependency for the build, only required if the
  protobuf definition is actually changed.

* MessageTemplate field name interpolation was only supporting alphabetic
  characters for field names, now supports all "word" characters (i.e.
  alphanumeric plus underscore).

* ElasticSearchOutput now always sends timestamps in expected UTC time zone
  format.

* Fixed a CarbonOutput memory / socket leak.

* Fixed panic caused by an invalid config file path.

Features
--------

* Added a sandbox message field iterator (issue #460)

* Added ProcessInput. (issue #406)

* Replaced DashboardOutput UI with new Backbone.js-based `dasher` interface.
  (issue #378)

* Add delta output to circular buffers. (issue #467)

* Added json decoding to the Lua sandbox (issue #463). If you have an old build
  directory you will have to run make clean to pick up the new patch.

* Added a 'config' variable section to the Sandbox decoder/filter plugin.
  (issue #444)

* Added StatsToFieldsDecoder that will convert a message with statsd formatted
  string in the payload to one that also has the data available as message
  fields, in the same format that would be generated by a StatAccumInput with
  `emit_in_fields` set to true.

* MultiDecoder now supports `cascade_strategy` config options of `first-wins`
  and `all`, defaults to `first-wins`.

* Added stream parsing to UdpInput. (issue #411)

* Added stream parsing to TcpInput. (issue #165)

* Added SandboxDecoder. (issue #370)

* Support Heka protobuf message data in the LogfileInput plugin. (issue #261)

* Added "payload" format option to ElasticSearchOutput to pass message payload
  through to ES unchanged.

* Allow LogfileInput to use configurable delimiters including regexp (issue #263)
  This includes a backwards incompatible change for the journal file, old
  journals will not be honored and the new journal will overwrite it.

* Allow add_external_plugin to specify sub-packages. (issue #384)

* Added `base_dir` global (i.e. `[hekad]` section) config option to specify a
  single location Heka plugins should use to persist data to the file system.

* The `hekad` commands `config` flag now supports use of a config directory in
  addition to a single config file. If a directory path is specified, every
  file in the directory will be parsed and they will all be merged to a single
  running configuration.

* Added LogfileDirectoryManagerInput (issue #344).

* LPEG library added to Lua sandbox (issue #144).

* ElasticSearchOutput now supports `logstash_v0` output format that is modeled
  after the original Logstash ElasticSearch message schema.

* Added PayloadJsonDecoder that can extract information from JSON text in a
  message payload during decoding.

* Make index type_name option for ElasticSearchOutput definable from Field value (issue #356)

0.3.0 (2013-07-16)
==================

* Fixed default (and only supported, for now) sample rate in the stats
  generated by the StatFilter.

* Fixes to the platform specific build constraints around signal handling.

* Added HttpInput that can make HTTP requests to a remote server, placing
  the response body into a message payload.

* Filters and outputs now require a specified message_matcher or they will
  raise an error applying the configuration.

* ticker_interval now exposed as a global config option for inputs, as well
  as outputs and filters.

* Overhaul of StatAccumInput implementation to fix bugs and allow for better
  handling of output format options.

* LoglineDecoder will now default to the current day, month, and year when
  parsing text that contains bare timestamps w/ no date information.

* Added permission checks to FileOutput and WhisperOutput plugins to fail
  gracefully when they've been asked to write to a location where they do not
  have write permission.

* Fixed folder creation permission bugs and allow configurable folder
  permission settings in FileOutput and WhisperOutput.

* `hekad` now emits help message if started w/ no command line options.

* Consistently use underscore_separated_words for plugin TOML configuration
  options.

* Use strings instead of integers to specify octal permission values in the
  config, since TOML doesn't support octal integer values.

* LoglineDecoder config now allows specification of a time zone in case the
  parsed text contains non-UTC timestamps that don't include embedded time
  zone information.

* Removed match capture group support from the router's message matching
  functionality, since this is better done in the decoder layer where the
  back-pressure won't slow down all message delivery. This gets rid of the
  `PipelineCapture` object altogether, so now filter and output plugins deal
  w/ PipelinePacks directly.

* Added ElasticSearch output.

* Lua filters can now emit tables, which will be serialized to JSON and
  put in an injected message payload.

* Custom dashboard javascript now generated by Heka instead of hosted
  remotely.

* Improvements to flood, a Heka protocol load test client.

* Config loading now fails if a config section specifies an unrecognized
  configuration option.

* StatAccumulator now supports stat metric messages with stats data embedded
  in message fields as well as message payload.

* Added support for plugin code to provide message_matcher and ticker_interval
  default values.

* Reimplemented StatMonitor as StatAccumInput, providing a StatAccumulator
  interface.

* SIGUSR1 signals now generate Heka report on stdout instead of sending
  a message so it can be viewed even when message delivery is hosed.

* Added explicit Close() calls to whisperdb files in WhisperOutput.

* Redesigned message field metadata to use string specifiers instead of
  an enum.

* Lua filters can now emit multiple named outputs to the Heka dashboard.

* LogfileInput now supports just one file per input.

* Removed race conditions exposed by Go's race detector.

* Improved self monitoring / dashboard output.

* Improved shutdown message flushing.

* Added Nagios output.

* Added support for LogfileInput to resume parsing where it left off.

* Added AMQP input and output plugins.

* Improved control over sandbox filter message injection restrictions.

* Added support for restartable plugins.

* Moved regular expression and capture group parsing out of the filter layer
  (i.e. in the TransformFilter) and into the decoder layer (i.e.
  LoglineDecoder) to prevent back pressure from impacting the entire router.

0.2.0 (2013-06-26)
==================

* Fix stat name regex to capture "." characters in the name.

0.2.0rc2 (2013-05-23)
=====================

* Fix Lua sandbox C code to work on 32 bit systems.

* Trivial release documentation ReST formatting fix.

0.2.0rc1 (2013-05-21)
=====================

* Use non-https links in docs to prevent bad rendering due to mixed http/https
  content.

* A number of documentation tweaks and updates.

* Static linking of cgo wrapped Lua environment.

* Added LICENSE.txt and CHANGES.txt for better project hygiene.

* Changed default interval for log file reading from 1ms to 500ms so we don't
  churn the machine in default configuration.

* Moved StatPacket channel setup into StatsdInput's Init method (from Run) to
  avoid race conditions.

* Added support for mingw-based Windows build.

* Perform message injection in a goroutine to prevent blocking the router when
  the plugin that is doing the injection has a full in channel.

* Added required pack recycling to TcpOutput.

0.2.0b1 (2013-04-30)
====================

* Initial public release

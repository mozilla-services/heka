0.3.0 (2013-07-16)
==================

* Fixed default (and only supported, for now) sample rate in the stats
  generated by the StatFilter.

* Fixes to the platform specific build constraints around signal handling.

* Added HttpInput that can make HTTP requests to a remote server, placing
  the response body into a message payload.

* Filters and outputs now require a specified message_matcher or they will
  raise an error applying the configuration.

* ticker_interval now exposed as a global config option for inputs, as well
  as outputs and filters.

* Overhaul of StatAccumInput implementation to fix bugs and allow for better
  handling of output format options.

* LoglineDecoder will now default to the current day, month, and year when
  parsing text that contains bare timestamps w/ no date information.

* Added permission checks to FileOutput and WhisperOutput plugins to fail
  gracefully when they've been asked to write to a location where they do not
  have write permission.

* Fixed folder creation permission bugs and allow configurable folder
  permission settings in FileOutput and WhisperOutput.

* `hekad` now emits help message if started w/ no command line options.

* Consistently use underscore_separated_words for plugin TOML configuration
  options.

* Use strings instead of integers to specify octal permission values in the
  config, since TOML doesn't support octal integer values.

* LoglineDecoder config now allows specification of a time zone in case the
  parsed text contains non-UTC timestamps that don't include embedded time
  zone information.

* Removed match capture group support from the router's message matching
  functionality, since this is better done in the decoder layer where the
  back-pressure won't slow down all message delivery. This gets rid of the
  `PipelineCapture` object altogether, so now filter and output plugins deal
  w/ PipelinePacks directly.

* Added ElasticSearch output.

* Lua filters can now emit tables, which will be serialized to JSON and
  put in an injected message payload.

* Custom dashboard javascript now generated by Heka instead of hosted
  remotely.

* Improvements to flood, a Heka protocol load test client.

* Config loading now fails if a config section specifies an unrecognized
  configuration option.

* StatAccumulator now supports stat metric messages with stats data embedded
  in message fields as well as message payload.

* Added support for plugin code to provide message_matcher and ticker_interval
  default values.

* Reimplemented StatMonitor as StatAccumInput, providing a StatAccumulator
  interface.

* SIGUSR1 signals now generate Heka report on stdout instead of sending
  a message so it can be viewed even when message delivery is hosed.

* Added explicit Close() calls to whisperdb files in WhisperOutput.

* Redesigned message field metadata to use string specifiers instead of
  an enum.

* Lua filters can now emit multiple named outputs to the Heka dashboard.

* LogfileInput now supports just one file per input.

* Removed race conditions exposed by Go's race detector.

* Improved self monitoring / dashboard output.

* Improved shutdown message flushing.

* Added Nagios output.

* Added support for LogfileInput to resume parsing where it left off.

* Added AMQP input and output plugins.

* Improved control over sandbox filter message injection restrictions.

* Added support for restartable plugins.

* Moved regular expression and capture group parsing out of the filter layer
  (i.e. in the TransformFilter) and into the decoder layer (i.e.
  LoglineDecoder) to prevent back pressure from impacting the entire router.

0.2.0 (2013-06-26)
==================

* Fix stat name regex to capture "." characters in the name.

0.2.0rc2 (2013-05-23)
=====================

* Fix Lua sandbox C code to work on 32 bit systems.

* Trivial release documentation ReST formatting fix.

0.2.0rc1 (2013-05-21)
=====================

* Use non-https links in docs to prevent bad rendering due to mixed http/https
  content.

* A number of documentation tweaks and updates.

* Static linking of cgo wrapped Lua environment.

* Added LICENSE.txt and CHANGES.txt for better project hygiene.

* Changed default interval for log file reading from 1ms to 500ms so we don't
  churn the machine in default configuration.

* Moved StatPacket channel setup into StatsdInput's Init method (from Run) to
  avoid race conditions.

* Added support for mingw-based Windows build.

* Perform message injection in a goroutine to prevent blocking the router when
  the plugin that is doing the injection has a full in channel.

* Added required pack recycling to TcpOutput.

0.2.0b1 (2013-04-30)
====================

* Initial public release

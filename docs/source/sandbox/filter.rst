Sandbox Filter
==============
The sandbox filter provides an isolated execution environment for data analysis.
The output generated by the sandbox is injected into the payload of a new 
message for further processing or to be output.

Filter Parameters

SandboxFilter Settings
======================
 - script_type (string): The language the sandbox is written in.  Currently the only valid option is 'lua'.
 - filename (string): For a static configuration this is the full path to the sandbox code. The filename must be unique between static plugins, since the global data is preserved using this name. For a dynamic configuration the filename is ignored and the the physical location on disk is controlled by the SandboxManagerFilter.
 - preserve_data (bool): True if the sandbox global data should be preserved/restored on Heka shutdown/startup. The preserved data is stored along side the sandbox code i.e. counter.lua.data so Heka must have read/write permissions to that directory.
 - memory_limit (uint): The number of bytes the sandbox is allowed to consume before being terminated (max 8MiB, default 32767).
 - instruction_limit (uint): The number of instructions the sandbox is allowed the execute during the process_message/timer_event functions before being terminated (max 1M, default 1000).
 - output_limit (uint): The number of bytes the sandbox output buffer can hold before before being terminated (max 63KiB, default 1024).  Anything less than 1KiB will default to 1KiB.
 - profile (bool): When true a statistically significant number of ProcessMessage timings are immediately captured before reverting back to the regular sampling interval.  The main purpose is for more accurate sandbox comparison/tuning/optimization.

Example

.. code-block:: ini

    [hekabench_counter]
    type = "SandboxFilter"
    message_matcher = "Type == 'hekabench'"
    ticker_interval = 1
    script_type  = "lua"
    filename = "counter.lua"
    preserve_data = true
    memory_limit = 32767
    instruction_limit = 1000
    output_limit = 1024
    profile = false

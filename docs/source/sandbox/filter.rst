Sandbox Filter
==============
The sandbox filter provides an isolated execution environment for data analysis.
The output generated by the sandbox is injected into the payload of a new 
message for further processing or to be output.

.. _sandboxfilter_settings:

SandboxFilter Settings
----------------------

- :ref:`config_common_parameters`

- script_type (string): 
    The language the sandbox is written in.  Currently the only valid option is 'lua'.

- filename (string): 
    For a static configuration this is the path to the sandbox code; if specified as a relative path it will be appended to Heka's global base_dir. The filename must be unique between static plugins, since the global data is preserved using this name. For a dynamic configuration the filename is ignored and the the physical location on disk is controlled by the SandboxManagerFilter.

- preserve_data (bool):
    True if the sandbox global data should be preserved/restored on Heka shutdown/startup. The preserved data is stored along side the sandbox code i.e. counter.lua.data so Heka must have read/write permissions to that directory.

- memory_limit (uint): 
    The number of bytes the sandbox is allowed to consume before being terminated (max 8MiB, default max).

- instruction_limit (uint): 
    The number of instructions the sandbox is allowed the execute during the process_message/timer_event functions before being terminated (max 1M, default max).

- output_limit (uint): 
    The number of bytes the sandbox output buffer can hold before before being terminated (max 63KiB, default max).  Anything less than 64B is set to 64B.

- profile (bool): 
    When true a statistically significant number of ProcessMessage timings are immediately captured before reverting back to the regular sampling interval.  The main purpose is for more accurate sandbox comparison/tuning/optimization.

- module_directory (string): 
    The directory where 'require' will attempt to load the external Lua modules from.  Defaults to ${BASE_DIR}/lua_modules. For a dynamic configuration the module_directory is ignored and the the physical location on disk is controlled by the SandboxManagerFilter.

- config (object):
    A map of configuration variables available to the sandbox via read_config.  The map consists of a string key with: string, bool, int64, or float64 values.

Example

.. code-block:: ini

    [hekabench_counter]
    type = "SandboxFilter"
    message_matcher = "Type == 'hekabench'"
    ticker_interval = 1
    script_type  = "lua"
    filename = "counter.lua"
    preserve_data = true
    profile = false

    [hekabench_counter.config]
    rows = 1440
    sec_per_row = 60

Lua Sandbox
===========

The `Lua` sandbox provides full access to the Lua language in a
sandboxed environment under `hekad` that enforces configurable
restrictions.

.. seealso:: `Lua Reference Manual <http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/>`_

API
---

Functions that must be exposed from the Lua sandbox
---------------------------------------------------

**int process_message()**
    Called by Heka when a message is available to the sandbox.  The 
    instruction_limit configuration parameter is applied to this function call.

    *Arguments*
        none

    *Return*
        - < 0 for non-fatal failure (increments ProcessMessageFailures)
        - 0 for success
        - > 0 for fatal error (terminates the sandbox)

**timer_event(ns)**
    Called by Heka when the ticker_interval expires.  The instruction_limit 
    configuration parameter is applied to this function call.  This function
    is only required in SandboxFilters (SandboxDecoders do not support timer
    events).

    *Arguments*
        - ns (int64) current time in nanoseconds since the UNIX epoch

    *Return*
        none

Heka functions that are exposed to the Lua sandbox
---------------------------------------------------

**read_config(variableName)**
    Provides access to the sandbox configuration variables.

    *Arguments*
        - variableName (string)

    *Return*
        number, string, bool, nil depending on the type of variable requested

**read_message(variableName, fieldIndex, arrayIndex)**
    Provides access to the Heka message data.

    *Arguments*
        - variableName (string)
            - Uuid
            - Type
            - Logger
            - Payload
            - EnvVersion
            - Hostname
            - Timestamp
            - Severity
            - Pid
            - Fields[_name_]
        - fieldIndex (unsigned) only used in combination with the Fields variableName
            - use to retrieve a specific instance of a repeated field _name_
        - arrayIndex (unsigned) only used in combination with the Fields variableName
            - use to retrieve a specific element out of a field containing an array

    *Return*
        number, string, bool, nil depending on the type of variable requested

**output(arg0, arg1, ...argN)**
    Appends data to the payload buffer, which cannot exceed the output_limit 
    configuration parameter.

    *Arguments*
        - arg (number, string, bool, nil, table) Lua variable or literal to be appended the output buffer

    *Return*
        none
    
    *Notes*
        Outputting a Lua table will serialize it to JSON according to the following guidelines/restrictions:
            - Tables cannot contain internal of circular references.
            - Keys starting with an underscore are considered private and will not be serialized.
                - '_name' is a special private key that can be used to specify the the name of the top level JSON object, if not provided the default is 'table'.
            - Arrays only use contiguous numeric keys starting with an index of 1. Private keys are the exception i.e. local a = {1,2,3,_name="my_name"} will be serialized as: ``{"my_name":[1,2,3]}\n``
            - Hashes only use string keys (numeric keys will not be quoted and the JSON output will be invalid). Note: the hash keys are output in an arbitrary order i.e. local a = {x = 1, y = 2} will be serialized as: ``{"table":{"y":2,"x":1}}\n``.

**inject_message(payload_type, payload_name)**
    Creates a new Heka message using the contents of the output payload buffer
    and then clears the buffer. Two pieces of optional metadata are allowed and
    included as fields in the injected message i.e., Fields[payload_type] == 'csv' 
    Fields[payload_name] == 'Android Usage Statistics'.  The number of messages
    that may be injected by the process_message or timer_event functions are 
    globally controlled by the hekad :ref:`hekad_command_line_options`; if
    these values are exceeded the sandbox will be terminated.

    *Arguments*
        - payload_type (**optional, default "txt"** string) Describes the content type of the injected payload data.
        - payload_name (**optional, default ""** string) Names the content to aid in downstream filtering.

    *Return*
        none

**inject_message(message_table)**
    Creates a new Heka protocol buffer message using the contents of the
    specified Lua table (injection limits are enforced as described above).
    Notes about message fields:

    * Timestamp is automatically generated if one is not provided.  Nanosecond since the UNIX epoch is the only valid format.
    * UUID is automatically generated, anything provided by the user is ignored.
    * Hostname and Logger are automatically set by the SandboxFilter and cannot be overridden.
    * Type is prepended with "heka.sandbox." by the SandboxFilter to avoid data confusion/mis-representation.
    * Fields can be represented in multiple forms and support the following primitive types: string, double, bool.  These constructs should be added to the 'Fields' table in the message structure. Note: since the Fields structure is a map and not an array, like the protobuf message, fields cannot be repeated.
        * name=value i.e., foo="bar"; foo=1; foo=true
        * name={array} i.e., foo={"b", "a", "r"}
        * name={object} i.e. foo={value=1, representation="s"}; foo={value={1010, 2200, 1567}, representation="ms"}
            * value (required) may be a single value or an array of values
            * representation (optional) metadata for display and unit management

    *Arguments*
        - message_table A table with the proper message structure.

    *Return*
        none

**require(libraryName)**
    Loads optional sandbox libraries

    *Arguments*
        - libraryName (string)
            - **lpeg** loads the Lua Parsing Expression Grammar Library http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/lpeg.html

    *Return*
        none, the library is exposed as a global table with the library name.

Sample Lua Message Structure
----------------------------
.. code-block:: lua

    {
    Uuid        = "data",               -- always ignored
    Logger      = "nginx",              -- ignored in the SandboxFilter
    Hostname    = "bogus.mozilla.com",  -- ignored in the SandboxFilter

    Timestamp   = 1e9,                   
    Type        = "TEST",               -- will become "heka.sandbox.TEST" in the SandboxFilter
    Papload     = "Test Payload",
    EnvVersion  = "0.8",
    Pid         = 1234, 
    Severity    = 6, 
    Fields      = {
                http_status     = 200, 
                request_size    = {value=1413, representation="B"}
                }
    }

Lua Circular Buffer Library
===========================

The library is a sliding window time series data store and is implemented in
the ``circular_buffer`` table.

Constructor
-----------
circular_buffer.\ **new**\ (rows, columns, seconds_per_row)

    *Arguments*
        - rows (unsigned) The number of rows in the buffer (must be > 1)
        - columns (unsigned)The number of columns in the buffer (must be > 0)

    *Return*
        A circular buffer object.

Methods
-------
.. note::
    All column arguments are 1 based. If the column is out of range for the 
    configured circular buffer a fatal error is generated.

double **add**\ (nanoseconds, column, value)

    *Arguments*
        - nanosecond (unsigned) The number of nanosecond since the UNIX epoch. The value is used to determine which row is being operated on.
        - column (unsigned) The column within the specified row to perform an add operation on.
        - value (double) The value to be added to the specified row/column.

    *Return*
        The value of the updated row/column or nil if the time was outside the range of the buffer.

double **set**\ (nanoseconds, column, value)

    *Arguments*
        - nanosecond (unsigned) The number of nanosecond since the UNIX epoch. The value is used to determine which row is being operated on.
        - column (unsigned) The column within the specified row to perform a set operation on.
        - value (double) The value to be overwritten at the specified row/column.

    *Return*
        The value passed in or nil if the time was outside the range of the buffer.

double **get**\ (nanoseconds, column)

    *Arguments*
        - nanosecond (unsigned) The number of nanosecond since the UNIX epoch. The value is used to determine which row is being operated on.
        - column (unsigned) The column within the specified row to retrieve the data from.

    *Return*
        The value at the specifed row/column or nil if the time was outside the range of the buffer.

int **set_header**\ (column, name, unit, aggregation_method)

    *Arguments*
        - column (unsigned) The column number where the header information is applied.
        - name (string) Descriptive name of the column (maximum 15 characters). Any non alpha numeric characters will be converted to underscores. (default: Column_N)
        - unit (string - optional) The unit of measure (maximum 7 characters). Alpha numeric, '/', and '*' characters are allowed everything else will be converted to underscores. i.e. KiB, Hz, m/s (default: count)
        - aggregation_method (string - optional) Controls how the column data is aggregated when combining multiple circular buffers.
            - **sum** The total is computed for the time/column (default).
            - **min** The smallest value is retained for the time/column.
            - **max** The largest value is retained for the time/column.
            - **avg** The average is computed for the time/column.
            - **none** No aggregation will be performed the column.

    *Return*
        The column number passed into the function.

double **compute**\ (function, column, start, end)

    *Arguments*
        - function (string) The name of the compute function (sum|avg|sd|min|max).
        - column (unsigned) The column that the computation is performed against.
        - start (optional - unsigned) The number of nanosecond since the UNIX epoch. Sets the start time of the computation range; if nil the buffer's start time is used.
        - end (optional- unsigned) The number of nanosecond since the UNIX epoch. Sets the end time of the computation range (inclusive); if nil the buffer's end time is used. The end time must be greater than or equal to the start time.

    *Return*
        The result of the computation for the specifed column over the given range or nil if the range fell outside of the buffer.

Output
------
The circular buffer can be passed to the output() function.  The output will
consist newline delimited rows starting with a json header row followed by the
data rows with tab delimited columns. The time in the header corresponds to the 
time of the first data row, the time for the other rows is calculated using the
seconds_per_row header value.

.. code-block:: txt

    {json header}
    row1_col1\trow1_col2\n
    .
    .
    .
    rowN_col1\trowN_col2\n

Sample Output
-------------
.. code-block:: txt

    {"time":2,"rows":3,"columns":3,"seconds_per_row":60,"column_info":[{"name":"HTTP_200","unit":"count","aggregation":"sum"},{"name":"HTTP_400","unit":"count","aggregation":"sum"},{"name":"HTTP_500","unit":"count","aggregation":"sum"}]}

Lua Sandbox Tutorial
====================

How to create a simple sandbox filter
-------------------------------------

1. Implement the required Heka interface in Lua

.. code-block:: lua

    function process_message ()
        return 0
    end

    function timer_event(ns)
    end

2. Add the business logic (count the number of 'demo' events per minute)

.. code-block:: lua

    total = 0 -- preserved between restarts since it is in global scope
    local count = 0 -- local scope so this will not be preserved

    function process_message()
        total= total + 1
        count = count + 1
        return 0
    end

    function timer_event(ns)
        output(string.format("%d messages in the last minute; total=%d", count, total))
        count = 0
        inject_message()
    end

3. Setup the configuration

.. code-block:: ini

    [demo_counter]
    type = "SandboxFilter"
    message_matcher = "Type == 'demo'"
    ticker_interval = 60
    script_type = "lua"
    filename = "counter.lua"
    preserve_data = true
    memory_limit = 32767
    instruction_limit = 100
    output_limit = 256

4. Extending the business logic (count the number of 'demo' events per minute
per device)

.. code-block:: lua

    device_counters = {}

    function process_message()
        local device_name = read_message("Fields[DeviceName]")
        if device_name == nil then
            device_name = "_unknown_"
        end

        local dc = device_counters[device_name]
        if dc == nil then
            dc = {count = 1, total = 1}
            device_counters[device_name] = dc
        else
            dc.count = dc.count + 1
            dc.total = dc.total + 1
        end
        return 0
    end

    function timer_event(ns)
        output("#device_name\tcount\ttotal\n")
        for k, v in pairs(device_counters) do
            output(string.format("%s\t%d\t%d\n", k, v.count, v.total))
            v.count = 0
        end
        inject_message()
    end

5. Depending on the number of devices being counted you will most likely want to update the configuration to account for the additional resource requirements.

.. code-block:: ini

    memory_limit = 65536
    instruction_limit = 20000
    output_limit = 64512

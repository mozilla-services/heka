Sandboxes
=========

Sandboxes provide a dynamic and isolated execution environment for data
analysis. They allow real time access to data in production without
jeopardizing the integrity or performance of the monitoring
infrastructure. This broadens the audience that the data can be exposed
to and facilitates new uses of the data (i.e. debugging, monitoring,
dynamic provisioning,  SLA analysis, intrusion detection, ad-hoc
reporting, etc.)

Features
========

- dynamic loading - ability to start/stop on a self-service basis
- small - memory requirements are about 16 KiB for a basic sandbox
- fast - microsecond execution times
- stateful - ability to resume where it left off after a restart/reboot
- isolated - failures are contained and malfunctioning sandboxes are terminated

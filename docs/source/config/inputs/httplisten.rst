as the message payload. Messages will be populated as follows:

- Uuid: Type 4 (random) UUID generated by Heka.
- Timestamp: Time HTTP request is handled.
- Type: `heka.httpdata.request`
- Hostname: The remote network address of requester.
- Payload: Entire contents of the HTTP response body.
- Severity: 6
- Logger: HttpListenInput
- Fields["UserAgent"] (string): Request User-Agent header (e.g. "GitHub Hookshot dd0772a").
- Fields["ContentType"] (string): Request Content-Type header (e.g. "application/x-www-form-urlencoded").
- Fields["Protocol"] (string): HTTP protocol used for the request (e.g.
                               "HTTP/1.0")

    Defaults to "127.0.0.1:8325".

    It is possible to inject arbitrary HTTP headers into each outgoing response
    by adding a TOML subsection entitled "headers" to you HttpOutput config
    section. All entries in the subsection must be a list of string values.

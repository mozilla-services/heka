Monitoring Internal State
=========================

Heka can emit metrics about it's internal state to either an outgoing
Heka message (and, through the DashboardOutput, to a web dashboard) or
to stdout.
Sending SIGUSR1 to hekad on a UNIX will send a plain text report
tostdout. On Windows, you will need to send signal
10 to the hekad process using Powershell.

Sample text output ::

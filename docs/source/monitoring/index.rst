Monitoring Internal State
=========================

Heka Reports
------------

Heka can emit metrics about its internal state to either an outgoing Heka
message (and, through the DashboardOutput, to a web dashboard) or to stdout.
Sending SIGUSR1 to hekad on a UNIX will send a plain text report to stdout. On
Windows, you will need to send signal 10 to the hekad process using Powershell.

To enable the HTTP interface, you will need to enable the dashboard output
plugin, see :ref:`config_dashboard_output`.

Aborting When Wedged
--------------------

In some cases a misconfigured Heka instance or some other conditions can cause
Heka to suffer from "pack exhaustion", resulting in the process becoming wedged
such that no more data flows through the pipeline. In this case Heka will not
shut down cleanly when sent a SIGINT signal via ``ctrl-c``.

When this happens, Heka administrators should send a SIGUSR2 (or signal 11 on
Windows) to the hekad process. If Heka detects that messages are successfully
flowing through the system this will have no impact, but if Heka can verify
that the pipeline is wedged then the following sequence of events will be
triggered:

* A Heka report will be generated and output to the console, hopefully
  providing insight into what caused the wedging.

* A shutdown signal will be sent to the Heka pipeline, triggering a shut down
  if one hasn't already been sent.

* An `abort` signal will propagate through the Heka pipeline, causing any
  wedged sandboxes to become unwedged and immediately exit, preserving their
  state if specified with the ``preserve_data = true`` config setting.

When this has finished usually Heka will become unwedged and exit cleanly,
preserving the state of all so configured sandboxes. In some cases Heka will
still not exit cleanly and will require a SIGQUIT signal. Even in these cases,
however, state of sandbox plugins will often be serialized to disk such that
it's available after a restart.

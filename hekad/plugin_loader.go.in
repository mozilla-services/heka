This file can be used to load plugins that have been defined in other
packages. Simply rename `plugin_loader.go.in` to `plugin_loader.go`, import
the packages that define the plugins, and modify the `init` function so your
plugins are added to `AvailablePlugins` correctly.

The sample code below demonstrates how we use this capability within Mozilla
Services.
